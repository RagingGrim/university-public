# Complexity Analysis

Basically covers the fact that all algorithms have tradeoffs. In the case of complexity analysis space (RAM) and time (execution time) is mainly considered.

Let f(n) be the function that describes the complexity of an algorithm. We are only concerned with asymptotic complexity ; which is to say we are only concerned with the order of complexity ( magnitude of a function ).

This means that the function f(x) has a low order of complexity compared to g(x)<br>

## Big O Notation

### Introduction
Big O notation to describe the performance or complexity of an algorithm. Big O specifically describes the worst-case scenario, and can be used to describe the execution time required or the space used by an algorithm.

### Common algorthims
