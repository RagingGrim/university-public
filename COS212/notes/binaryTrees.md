# Binary Trees
A binary tree is a tree data structure in which each node has at most two children, which are referred to as the left child and the right child.

A labeled binary tree of size 9 and height 3, with a root node whose value is 2. The above tree is unbalanced and not sorted.

## Types of binary Trees
### Full binary tree
A full binary tree (sometimes referred to as a proper or plane binary tree) is a tree in which every node in the tree has either 0 or 2 children.

### Complete binary tree
In a complete binary tree every level, except possibly the last, is completely filled, and all nodes in the last level are as far left as possible
