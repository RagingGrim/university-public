## Definitions
### Ethics
Ethics is a branch of philosophy which deals with understanding the nature of morality, to distinguish that which is right from that which is wrong. It is a critical reflection on morals. There are different ways of approaching the subject: philosophers call ethics the “science of morality”, theologians consider ethics a branch of theology, ethics is used by professionals to refer to elements of professional practice, and ethics is linked with economics, feminism, and gender studies.

### Morals
Morals or morality refers to a system of principles and judgments by which humans decide whether certain actions are right or wrong. These customs and traditions are generalized and codified by a culture or a group, and serve to regulate behavior within that culture or group. Different cultures therefore have different morals according to which they live their everyday lives.

### Law
Law is a collection of rules of conduct for specific situations that are established, approved, and enforced by legislation or state authority.

## Values vs Ethics
**Values**: Convictions about what is good and desirable.
**Ethics**: Concerns itself with what is good or right in human interaction. Therefore, the interaction of good between self and other and the relationship between the two. Values can thus be exempted from ethical behavior since what is good does not necessarily have to be ethical. But when values become aligned with ethical behavior it contributes to the
understanding and implementation of ethics in economic, political, legal and social systems. In all, ethics is not selfish but self-interested.

## Computer and Information Ethics
Ethics is the study of morality. Generally it is neither rules nor regulations but should be view as guidelines. Applied, or normative ethics, provides guidance on distinguishing between what is generally right or wrong (generally), or between what is morally right or wrong in specific situations.
“Computer and information ethics”, in the broadest sense of this phrase, can be understood as that branch of applied ethics which studies and analyses such social and ethical impacts of ICT.

## Three IE levels
### Macro level
The broad social and environmental issues attributed to the features of the Information Age (like the Digital Divide and e-Waste).
### Meso level
Questions arising in the sphere of public policy, discourse and regulation of information (like Censorship).
### Micro level
The day-to-day handling of information throughout the Information life-cycle (like Plagiarism).

## Ethics Theories
### Virtue theory
Compiled by Aristotle in his Nicomachean Ethics. Everything in life has an ultimate goal, also known as telos. For humans, our telos is eudaimonia, roughly translated as happiness. However, this is not a common, superficial happiness, but rather one characterized by a life well lived. Either than in pursuit of knowledge, riches, etc.

For Aristotle there are four preconditions to the
attainment of eudaimonia (fulfillment):
- social environment
- friends
- material provisions
- and the self
The self then is further cultivated by virtues, ‘an activity of the soul, implying a rational principle’. This is where the ‘mean’ is introduced, i.e. for rashness and cowardice the mean would be courage. Therefore, the mean is found between an excess and deficiency of something.

#### Who
Aristotle, 384 to 322 B.C.
#### What
Virtue Ethics is a classification within Normative Ethics that attempts to discover and classify what might be deemed of moral character, and to apply the moral character as a base for one's choices and actions.

### Deontological ethics
The representative of this theory is Immanuel Kant. Where ‘virtue ethics claims that morality depends on the moral virtues of one’s character, deontological ethics insists that moral action requires conformity to moral principles’. Kant postulated the ‘universal moral law’ whereby a maxim to one’s actions, if it can be made universal, it is ethical. This categorical imperative therefore applies to everyone – heedless of personal goals, status or situation.

#### What
The word deontology derives from the Greek words for duty (deon) and science (or study) of (logos).
#### Why
Moral “ought” cannot be deduced from practical “is”
#### How
Three Categorical Imperatives – ASK yourself what the possible answers might be in accordance with the three categorical imperative as to judge whether an action can be ethically condoned (i.e. White lie: universal law? Is it your duty? Are you responsible for telling a white lie?

1. Universal Law/Maxim
2. So act as to treat humanity, whether in your own person or in that of another, in every case as and end never as a means only
3. Every human will is a will which in all its maxims give universal laws – we are not passive. Act on it as sense of duty

### Utilitarian ethics
