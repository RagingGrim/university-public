## What is privacy and information privacy?

**Privacy** is seen as an individual condition of life characterized by exclusion from publicity.

Privacy as a concept is closely related to information. Privacy as expressed by means of information implies that there are different categories of privacy namely:
- Private communications
- Privacy of the body
- Personal information
- Information about one’s possessions – closely related to property right.

## How does the dissemination of information actually affect privacy?

**Information mediates relationships**
- Personal relationships are developed or nurtured on the basis of information about an individual.
- Different relationships are based on different kinds of information. Think of social media.
- Privacy is important because it allows you to maintain a diversity of relationships.

ICTs are especially involved in these kinds of relationship. Information determines how we are treated by organizations. A credit company will extend the amount of credit depending on the kind and amount of information it has on you. What this means is that usually it is a computer that makes a decision about you and your credibility.

## Kinds of privacy and the technology that affects it
- Physical/accessibility privacy
- Decisional Privacy
- Psychological/Mental Privacy
- Informational Privacy

## What do we need to keep private?

#### Accountability
The entity that holds collected information must be in compliance with the bill.
<details>
  <summary>More details</summary>
This principle assigns responsibility to the party or institution that holds personal information in terms of compliance with the protection of personal information as set out in the Bill. It will be difficult for an organization to ensure that the requirements of the Bill are properly embedded within its business. Therefore, an individual at a suitably high level should be given the task of managing the organisation’s responsibilities in terms of the Bill.
</details>

#### Processing Limitations
Collected information should be used only for its original intended purpose.
<details>
  <summary>More details</summary>
This principle requires that personal information may only be collected directly from the data subject and processed in a fair and lawful manner. Fair processing implies that the processing must be done with consent of the individual, or where it is necessary to comply with a legal obligation, public law duty or contractual obligation. In order to protect individual right to privacy (as stated in section 14 of the constitution), the amount of personal information gathered should never exceed the purpose for which it is needed.

Any personal information collected must be for a specific, lawful, explicitly defined and legitimate purpose. The data subject should be aware of what information is being processed, the purpose for which the information is collected, and who the likely recipients of the information will be.

The collectors of such information must establish mechanisms to ensure that personal information is only kept for as long as it is required to fulfill the purpose for which it was collected. When information is destroyed, it must be done in a manner that prevents any reconstruction in an intelligible form.
</details>

#### Further Processing Limitation
If collected information will be further processed it requires additional consent.
<details>
  <summary>More details</summary>
Personal information may only be processed in a way that leads to the fulfillment of the purpose for which the information was collected initially. Further processing of information must only occur at the additional consent of the individual.

</details>

#### Openness

This principle is linked directly to an organisation’s duty to process information in a fair and transparent manner. Personal information may only be collected following the notification of the Commission and at the knowledge of the data subject.
</details>

#### Security Safeguards
The entity who collected the information is responsible for safeguarding the information.
<details>
  <summary>More details</summary>
The Bill requires the implementation of technical and organizational measures to secure the integrity of personal information, and to guard against the risk of loss, damage, interference, modification or destruction of personal information. Also, personal information should also be protected against any unauthorized or unlawful access or processing.

It is the organisation’s responsibility to:
- implement security measures to safeguard personal information held by the organization;
- respect personal information that is processed by third parties on behalf of the organization; and
- notify stakeholders if personal information has been compromised in any way.
