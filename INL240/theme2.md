## What is privacy and information privacy?

**Privacy** is seen as an individual condition of life characterized by exclusion from publicity.

Privacy as a concept is closely related to information. Privacy as expressed by means of information implies that there are different categories of privacy namely:
- Private communications
- Privacy of the body
- Personal information
- Information about one’s possessions – closely related to property right.

## How does the dissemination of information actually affect privacy?

**Information mediates relationships**
- Personal relationships are developed or nurtured on the basis of information about an individual.
- Different relationships are based on different kinds of information. Think of social media.
- Privacy is important because it allows you to maintain a diversity of relationships.

ICTs are especially involved in these kinds of relationship. Information determines how we are treated by organizations. A credit company will extend the amount of credit depending on the kind and amount of information it has on you. What this means is that usually it is a computer that makes a decision about you and your credibility.

## Kinds of privacy and the technology that affects it
- Physical/accessibility privacy
- Decisional Privacy
- Psychological/Mental Privacy
- Informational Privacy
